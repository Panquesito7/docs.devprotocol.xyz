# Clubs

Clubs are a no-code DAO tool that anyone can start for free. Joining Clubs is as easy as starting a blog. With just a few clicks you can start issuing tokens, funding with DeFi, and offering incentives that have been nearly impossible for non technical creators in the past.

## Key Features
Equipped with powerful features of the Dev Protocol, it offers a variety of functions that can be used safely by creators without specialized knowledge.

### 1. Safe and high-performance, project specific tokens
From the identity verification function, which can only be issued by the project owner, to the revenue management function through staking, individual creators can start funding and providing incentives through their DAO from day one, without having to assume the risk of a token sale.

### 2. A variety of features to energize the community
From decentralized projects to fan communities of creators, communities of local activity, and clubs for sharing hobbies, DAO and Web3 can be incorporated into a variety of communities to help them grow. Below we give a recap of just a few of them,with more planned for the future.

- Governance

One of the hardest parts about running a community is giving your supporters a way to interact with the project in a way to affect meaningful change. Clubs give the creators the ability to add a governance layer on top of their club to allow voting, suggestions,etc. This governance feature greatly increases interaction and understanding of what the patrons desire from the creator and vice versa. We expect the governance feature to be extremely important in the future for building out Clubs and DAOs with Dev Protocol.

- Perks

For creators, Clubs will give you the ability to connect with your community, offer them rewards for their patronage, which could range from anything to unique NFTs, behind the scenes videos or monthly goodies sent directly to their front door. Incentivize new patrons to join your community and get involved in your project by rewarding them for their continued support. 

Want to only reward the most dedicated supporters with certain perks? As a creator you will have the ability to only reward patrons who stake a certain amount of support. This feature will give you complete control for exactly how you want to run your perks and fundraising.

- Auctions

In addition to the perks system available in clubs, we are giving creators the option to conduct private auctions between their supporters. Auctions help projects raise funds while offering unique NFTs and other collectibles to their staunchest of supporters. For the stakers and supporters, this is a way to show everyone their dedication to the project. Auctions direct to the community have always been a difficult challenge for many creators and we hope our Auction system can offer a solution that benefits both parties. 

- Quests

Quests are a unique feature for Clubs that allow creators to offer bounties for specific tasks they might need done. For example, a project may want to expand their audience and require translation of blog posts, which could be offered as a quest. Any member of the community could rise to the challenge and complete the Quest, provided they have the expertise. The reward from completing a Quest could range from an NFT commemorating your work to a personalized thank you video from the creator. The possibilities are endless and left completely up to the creator. 

### 3. In collaboration with Polygon Studios
Clubs is developed through an [official collaboration with Polygon Studios](https://medium.com/devprtcl/clubs-powered-by-polygon-1d19e0a44a7d), the fastest and most efficient way to build your DAO for your community and supporters with just a few clicks, taking full advantage of Polygon.
