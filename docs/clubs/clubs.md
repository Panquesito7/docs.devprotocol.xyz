Clubs is a WordPress-like product for building DAOs, designed to make all the features based on Dev Protocol more plainly usable by everyone with built-in UIs.

Clubs defines every DAO as a "Club".

Anyone can set up a club using [clubs.place](https://www.clubs.place), a cloud edition that makes it easy to use Clubs, and [clubs-core](https://github.com/dev-protocol/clubs-core), its open-source core.

Clubs is expanding its open-source plugin ecosystem, allowing any web developer to develop and publish plugins to extend the functionality and look and feel of Clubs and share them with the exciting community.
