Dev Protocol composes many modules as middleware, providing a variety of developer experiences tailored to the desired goals of each user.

Using Clubs is the simplest and best option for many. With no-code, you can customize plugins and themes to build your Web3 home on your own domain. If you want to use Clubs in a fully controlled environment, you can also use clubs-core. You can also use Dev Protocol core module and Dev Kit JS to start building new Dapps or businesses using all on-chain primitive APIs.

## Extendable Modules Overview

And your configurable area is also in the core module of Dev Protocol. You can also develop "Market" as a token authentication method, use cases for the ERC-20 tokens you mint, and have full control over the behavior of sTokens, which are NFTs that represent staking positions.
