## How to Create a Social Token

Social tokens are a type of cryptocurrency that is built around a creator, community, or brand. It is a way that helps Creators to monetize their works without relying on third-party platforms or agencies. With Niwa, you can issue social tokens (FT*) specialized for creators, and freely combine them with various Dapps to start a creator economy using Web3.

*FT: Fungible tokens with multiple issuance amounts, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is characterized by high liquidity compared to NFTs. A type of FT, the DEV protocol's Property token has many features such as staking, co-ownership, and revenue sharing.

## Introduction

In order to register (tokenize) your work or activity to the Dev Protocol, you will need to complete the registration process from Niwa. You will need your wallet for the registration process. Make sure you have your wallet ready before you register!

## What is a wallet?

A wallet is used for managing your crypto assets. You need to have a wallet to store the DEV tokens issued by Ethereum and Dev Protocol. Since Dev Protocol doesn’t provide you with a wallet function, you have to get one by yourself.

If you don't have a wallet yet, I recommend [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).
There is also a Chrome Extension version of MetaMask, so if you want to use Niwa from your PC, I recommend you to use this version.
You will then need to add the network settings to your wallet.

[How to add an Arbitrum One network](https://wiki.rugdoc.io/docs/how-to-connect-metamask-to-the-arbitrum-one-network/)

## Connecting the wallet to Niwa

To connect your wallet (MetaMask) to Niwa, click "Connect Wallet" on the right side of the header.
Please connect to the network where you want to use the wallet.

## About gas prices

For more information about gas prices, [please visit](https://devprotocol.xyz/faq)
In order to register with Niwa, you will need to pay for gas. The cost of the gas you need will vary depending on the congestion of the network you choose to onboard.
The base currency of each network will be used for gas: Ethereum for Arbitrum, matic for Polygon.
