## What is Niwa?

// TODO ここににわのロゴ画像

Niwa is the second official Dapp built on the Dev Protocol.It was released in February 2022 with the concept of wanting it to be a place where the community could gather.
Niwa is a platform that allows creators to smoothly tokenize their work and for creators and sponsors to stake DEV tokens.

Main Features

1. tokenize creators' works and activities.
2. get sponsors and raise funds from the community.
3. both creators and sponsors can earn DEV tokens through staking.

## What is staking?

It is a mechanism to contribute to the network by locking (temporarily making inaccessible) cryptographic assets; in the case of Dev, if you stake a "DEV token" (ERC20) to support a creator's work, you will receive a DEV token as a reward.

## How will you use it?

Please access and use the site from your browser.
The domain will change for each network, so you can select the one you want to use.
Currently, Arbitrum and Polygon are available for selection.
