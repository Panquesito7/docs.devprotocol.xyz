## What is Niwa? ðŸŒˆ

Niwa is the second official Dapp built on the Dev Protocol. It was released in February 2022 with the concept of wanting it to be a place where the community could gather. It is specially made to be used by creators by letting them mint and manage social tokens. You can try a new type of organization instead of a conventional business corporation in order to realize creative projects.

### Main Features

1. Issuance and management of social tokens
2. Project authentication (asset tokenization) â€»1
3. Staking to social tokens
4. Issuance and management of supporter proof NFT (sToken) â€»2

â€»1: As of February 2022, GitHub repository and YouTube channel tokenization are supported. More platforms will be supported. 
â€»2: A supporter proof NFT (sToken) will be issued automatically when the token is staked.

## How will you use it?
